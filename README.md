Basic Symbolic calculations in Java.

This package is designed as an interpreter of symbolic calculations. It provides almost all common mathematical functions, can perform basic simplifications, numeric algorithms like binary search and optimization is designed to run as efficient as possible in the interpretation and calculation of expressions, without using just in time compilation.

Please have a look into our [Wiki](https://github.com/PaulStahr/JSymMath/wiki) for more information.

You are thinking about using this software but are not sure if it makes sense in your project? Here are some use-cases for which this package is currently in use:
* Adding more functionality to a TextField allowing mathematical expressions
* As a more advanced calculator for your computer or mobile
* Visualizing mathemtical functions: [CalGraph3D](https://github.com/PaulStahr/CalGraph3D)
